Just a simple snake game written in Kotlin.

If you want to contribute just fork the project, make your changes and create a pull-request.

This project is mostly finished. Maybe I'll fix some bugs when I notice them.

### How can I play it?
You can download it [here](https://github.com/Trqhxrd/Snake/releases/latest) and run it with `java -jar snake-1.1.1.jar` or just double-click it if you're on windows.
Java 8 is required to run it!
